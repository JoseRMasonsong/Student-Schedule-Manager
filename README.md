An in-depth scheduling application suitable for a school with special-needs students. The schedule will be held in a database that can be managed when logged in with valid credentials. 
The schedule allows the user to find and manage the schedules of students within the school, providing a more intuitive interface to scheduling. There is a possibility this scheduling can be available for teachers as well, but it depends if the team will have enough time 
within the development frame. The project consists of three main parts: determining the database solution that will hold the records of each individual student which the fields inside the database will be the dates and records the time that specific student is occupied 
and what they are occupied with, developing an administrative interface that would allow for adding and removing records for managing day-to-day tasks of the student, and developing a user interface to expose the records to the end user that will receive it.
